1. Import the required modules (e.g., socket)

2. Set the target IP address or hostname

3. Define a range of ports to scan

4. Create a function to check if a port is open:
   a. Create a socket object
   b. Set a timeout for the connection attempt
   c. Use the `connect()` method to attempt a connection
   d. If the connection is successful, the port is open; close the socket
   e. If an exception occurs, the port is closed

5. Iterate over the range of ports:
   a. Call the function to check if the port is open
   b. If the port is open, print a message indicating it is open

6. Run the program
